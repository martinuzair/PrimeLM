# PrimeLM
PrimeLM is an education-based website that was made for the purpose of my Diploma-level Web Development assignment completion. PrimeLM will require the use of XAMPP to operate, as well as to run phpMyAdmin and MySQL. 

Steps to launch PrimeLM
1. In XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL.
2. In your web browser, type in localhost/1-MainLogin.php
3. Enjoy!
